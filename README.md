## Project Status

Completed

## Project Description

The purpose of this case is to identify the model and the insights extracted from the data.  

The data set contains daily weather observations from some weather stations in Australia.
 
The tables are set apart and the columns descriptions were saved on the `data_dictionary.md` archieve.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model to determine whether or not it will rain tomorrow.

## The Steps

In this project, I used data cleaning, manipulation and visualization libraries as well as scikit-learn for model development.

During the project, after cleaning and statistical exploration, I observed cases of data leakage, redundancy and behavior patterns of variables.

Several iterations of predictive models such as the decision tree with different methods for variable selection were performed.

In this methodology, concepts of tree reducing size, depth analysis and error graph were used.

After that, the LGBM method was used with all numerical variables, with the most important variables using plot importance and with column reduction.

As next steps, I would create new column to add information to the model as a new column called ‚Äúseason of the year‚Äù.

## Conclusion



## Data

The data is organized into two tables:

- `rain_data_aus.csv`: Contains most information for all seasons.

- `wind_table_01.csv a wind_table_08.csv`: Contains wind speed and orientation information.
